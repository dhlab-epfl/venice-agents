# LLM Agents for Interactive Exploration of Historical Cadastre Data: Framework and Application to Venice

This repository contains the implementation for the research paper: **LLM Agents for Interactive Exploration of Historical Cadastre Data: Framework and Application to Venice** ([arXiv:2505.17148](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17148)) published in **Computational Humanities Research**.

This research explores Venice's urban history during the critical period from 1740 to 1808, capturing the transition following the fall of the ancient Republic and the Ancien R√©gime. The work addresses the challenges of processing complex, non-standardized cadastral data through two complementary approaches:

1. **SQL Agent**: For handling structured queries about specific cadastral information
2. **Coding Agents**: For complex analytical operations requiring custom data manipulation

## Methodology

Our framework implements a text-to-programs approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language queries into executable code for processing historical cadastral records. The system is designed to:

- Bridge past and present urban landscapes through spatial queries
- Handle diverse formats and human annotations in historical data
- Generate verifiable program outputs to minimize hallucination
- Enable reconstruction of past population information, property features, and spatiotemporal comparisons

## Repository Structure

üìÅ [sql_agent](sql_agent/) - Contains the SQL Agent implementation for structured queries.

üìÅ [coding_agents](coding_agents/) - Contains the Coding Agents implementation for open-ended questions.
